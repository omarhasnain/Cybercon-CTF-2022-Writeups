# Cybercon-CTF-2022-Writeups
Hello Guys, Recently I participated in a Jeopardy Style CTF called Cybercon 2022 . There I solved some challenges . I will keep updating those challenges' solutions time to time. Hope it will help those who are completely new to Jeopardy Style CTF .


To solve the basic Network Challenges- 
1. You may need a **Notepad++** software. If you don't have this software then go through this link https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ and download it according to your device's configuration.
2. You will need a **Wireshark** Software. If you don't have that software then go through this link https://www.wireshark.org/download.html and download it according to your device's configuration.
